		<h1>LED Array</h1>
		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p>The plan is to make a 8x8 (64) addressable LED array that can be controlled
			over usb. The following funcionalities are required</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The board should be powered by a USB-C connection from a Laptop</li>
			<li>Each individual LED should be addressable.</li>
			<li>The user should be able to write to the array in frames.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Prototype LED Strip</h2>
		<p>As an initial starting point I designed a small board to test some addressable
			leds to get an initial idea of how the LEDS work. I decided on the <a
				href="https://docs.rs-online.com/f0be/A700000008421324.pdf">KAAF-5050RGBST-IC12</a> addressable LED and
			designed a small prototype based on the application circuit.

		<h2>Initial Board Idea</h2>
		<p>I decided upon the NXP KL25x series of microcontrollers to be the brains of the project, the MCU uses a
			32-bit ARM-CortexM0 core and is 32 bit. The mcu was chosen as it fulfills the basic requirements of the
			project and it an affordable choice. I also chose
			this chip as I wanted to explore resource constrained systems.

		Looking at the FRDM-KL25x schematics it appears that the MCU circuit contains the follwowing parts;
		<ul>
			<li>Crystal</li>
			<li>3v3 Voltage Regulator</li>
			<li>10-pin Debug Connector</li>
		</ul>
		Alongside this according to the datahseet the LEDs have a supply voltage, \(V_{DD}\), of \(5V\) with an input
		voltage \(V_{I}\) of \(-0.5\leq V_I \leq V_{DD}+0.5\), so I felt that a level shifter is required to shift the
		GPIO from 3v3 to 5v, looking online I found an 8-bit level shifter which shifts all 8 inputs up. Flashing will
		be done using a 10 pin debug header for JTAG.
